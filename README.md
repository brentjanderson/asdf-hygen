Special thanks to [asdf-github-cli](https://github.com/bartlomiejdanek/asdf-github-cli) author [Bart≈Çomiej Danek](https://github.com/bartlomiejdanek) and [asdf-golang](https://github.com/kennyp/asdf-golang/) author [Kenny Parnell](https://github.com/kennyp) for their plugins. I lifted the code from their work as the baseline for asdf-hygen.
